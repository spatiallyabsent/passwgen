# passwgen
project for a password generator in javaS This project was meant as an early JavaScript code learning project where we were expected 
to create a random number generater and allow a user to specify which types of characters they could choose from. 
As a developer we had to make sure that there choices could vary and properly produce code to acheive this desired outcome.
